# ğŸ’»Minecraft-Licence-TestğŸ“‹

ğŸŒ€ This is a test licence plugin, working in such a way that: 
* if 1 server has your plugin licensed (e.g. 1234-5678), then the 2nd server when it tries to upload the same plugin with the same licence, the plugin will shut down (or the server depending on the settings).
* There are 2 versions of the possibility to save licences:
  * 1 in config
  * 2 in code
